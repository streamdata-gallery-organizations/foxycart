description: FoxyCart is a hosted PCI compliant e-commerce platform built to empower
  web developers and designers with a powerful and flexible platform with which to
  add e-commerce functionality to existing systems. Its not an all-in-one system with
  an integrated CMS, CRM, email marketing system, or anything else. Weve chosen flexibility
  over bloat, power over features, and built the most flexible and streamlined cart
  and checkout system available.
